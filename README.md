# Vega Dashboard Exercise

This is Pedro's implementation of the Vega Frontend Coding Task.

## tl;dr

You can skip installation and see a deployed version of this application at [https://luxury-khapse-a5f46f.netlify.app/](https://luxury-khapse-a5f46f.netlify.app/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## A couple of notes regarding this solution

1) The login screen takes any email and password combination. Login using the same email for a custom message.
2) I've used the provided schema as a reference. However, I've decided to hardcode the data and the endpoint `/assets` returns a response already catered for the application.
